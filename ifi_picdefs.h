* DESCRIPTION: 
*  This include file contains definitions for the 18f8520 PICmicro.  All 
*  register definitions are explained in detail in the PIC18FXX20 Data Sheet.   
*
* USAGE:
*  Refer to this file to determine if a register is off-limits to the user.
*  Registers and bits marked by "Reserved - Do not use" should not be modified
*  by the user's code or else the Robot Controller will not function.
